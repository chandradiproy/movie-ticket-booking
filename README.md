# **Movie Ticket Booking System (Java Swing & MongoDB)**

A desktop application developed using Java Swing for the GUI and MongoDB for the database, allowing users to browse movies, select seats, and book tickets. This project was created as part of the OOP-II \[MCA 4221\] course at the Department of Data Science & Computer Applications.

## **Overview**

This project implements a functional movie ticket booking system with the following core features:

* **User Authentication:** Secure login for registered users.  
* **Movie Browsing:** Displays available movies, descriptions, theatres, and showtimes fetched from the database.  
* **Visual Seat Selection:** Interactive seat map showing available, booked, and user-selected seats for a chosen showtime.  
* **Booking Process:** Calculates the total cost based on selected seats and simulates payment confirmation.  
* **Database Integration:** Saves user credentials, movie details, and booking information to a MongoDB database.  
* **Confirmation:** Provides users with booking confirmation details upon successful completion.

## **Features**

* User Login  
* Movie Listing and Details View  
* Showtime Selection  
* Graphical Seat Selection Grid  
* Indication of Available/Booked/Selected Seats  
* Booking Summary and (Simulated) Payment  
* Booking Confirmation Display  
* Back Button Navigation through booking steps

## **Technologies Used**

* **Language:** Java (JDK 11 or higher recommended)  
* **GUI:** Java Swing  
* **Database:** MongoDB (Community Server)  
* **Build & Dependency Management:** Apache Maven  
* **MongoDB Java Driver:** `mongodb-driver-sync`

## **Project Setup and Execution**

**(For a detailed guide, please refer to Section 3: "Project Setup and Execution Guide" in the project report.)**

### **Prerequisites**

* JDK 11+  
* Apache Maven  
* MongoDB Community Server  
* Visual Studio Code (Recommended) with "Extension Pack for Java"

### **Setup Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandradiproy/movie-ticket-booking
   cd movieticketbooking
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:** Open the cloned `movieticketbooking` folder in Visual Studio Code. Ensure the Java extensions recognize it as a Maven project.  
3. **Start MongoDB:** Make sure your MongoDB server instance is running (usually on `mongodb://localhost:27017`).  
4. **Populate Database:** The application requires initial data.  
   * Connect to MongoDB using `mongosh` or MongoDB Compass.  
   * Run the sample data insertion scripts provided (see mongo\_sample\_data\_all artifact or separate script file if created) to create the movie\_booking\_db database and populate the users and movies collections.  
5. **Build with Maven:** Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (ensure you are in the project root directory) and run:  
   mvn clean install

   This downloads dependencies and compiles the project. Look for `BUILD SUCCESS`.

### **Running the Application**

After a successful build, you can run the application in several ways:

1. **From VS Code (Recommended):**  
   * Navigate to `src/main/java/com/ticketbook/movieapp/App.java`.  
   * Right-click and select "Run Java" or use the Run icon above the `main` method.  
2. **Using Maven Exec Plugin (Terminal):**  
   * In the project root directory, run:  
   ```bash
     mvn exec:java
   ```
3. **Using the Executable JAR (Terminal):**  
   * Navigate to the `target` directory: cd `target`  
   * Run the JAR (the exact filename might vary slightly based on version):
   ``` bash  
   java \-jar movieticketbooking-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```
